### What is the case to resolve?
Implement a program that guess a number with a minimal number of attempts

**Competition rules:**
- The program generates a random number from 0 to 100 that needs to be guessed. That means to implement a program to guess the number.
- Algorithm takes in account information if the generated number less or greater than thied one.

**Quality metric**

The result is valued by average number of tries for 1000 repeats

**What are practicing**

Learning how to write good Python code
